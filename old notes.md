# Website
Beginning of svelte/v website mini project 
https://framer.com/projects/Nam-prac--NrsnozhNvvcNIcQFcbUG-1EOhp?node=bPJ0zlbQz


# Framer
Using framer not figma(Using the framer animation possibly use a dragon animation into word/logo
- Use this animation https://x.com/socoloffalex/status/1806589283311980878 into https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWIkVfnd2g&ab_channel=ToniJ%C3%A4rvinen-DesignTutorials
- https://framer.com/projects/Start-Craft-Remix-copy--1xrh7EANRfE2Vxwb4Vff-bc2rv?node=augiA20Il (Framer example)
- https://framer.com/projects/Sawad-copy--Q3KZuTFRjKt8UFJGGbZM-5x7wZ?fp_sid=sawad&node=augiA20Il (Example for picture profile)
- For scroll down after first animation can us like read or red arrow saying scroll down (First page) can be floating (moving up and down but if too distracting just do static)
- Taskbar first page after animation finishes fades in ( https://framer.com/projects/Appverse-Ultimate-App-showcase-and-Startup-template-copy--pRfWY3w3m8Nv14ZZCFeR-gv8eH?node=augiA20Il ) this taskbar is something i want - follows as the user scrolls down (website has the multiple dif) (mobile has bar that shows up)
  
Color pallete
- Black: #0C120C
- Red: #CC2114
- Gray: #C7D6D5

Taskbar
- White: #EBE1E1 (For the taskbar)

DESIGN/CREATE LAYOUT FIRST -> ADD FEATURES AFTER(Use typeface and Colors later)
(Using just family name Ton that in chu nom as logo) -> Keep simplicity
Sidebar scroll animation(Make fade in n out to not disrupt the visuals:possibly just make it regular sidebar completion animation


# Features:
- Simplistic
- Home -> About ->Skills -> Education/Experience(Combined) -> Contact(Separate email)



- Home(Nam) Ton That (In chu nom) - roll in animation (then after topbar appears in and tells you to scroll down)
- About (I need a picture of myself first) - Viet/American  (born in ohio moved to Cali love sports love to learn and read)
- Skills Ux/ui Ai, Data visualization (Tableu, etc)
- Education/ex[erience College Senior (csulb 2024)
- contact (other email)

# Documentation 
- July 22 (Adding scrollbar logo(chu nom) -> still need to make other iterations for pages)
- July 23 (Still adjusting bar got the scroll bar for the page to be setup (Still need to set up the sections first then do the connections to the pages) -> Solution to adding sections move the text to a section and see if it works if it does work then remove first page)
- July 24 Still need to continue with july 23th actions













Home (Cool interface with color pallete chosen)

About (Talk a little bit about me my activities and maybe a little bit of my family)
(Talk about the experience of creating the site and what I went throguh reading learning svelte and willing to read and learn more to develop better experiences for people)

Skills (User interface design, Data science, Web Dev, etc)

Education/experience combined (Worked at bowling alley -> Cs degree at csulb)
could add projects and timewise

Deciding whether to do one page scroll down or multiple pages
On This Idea(Can Have big accentuated letters) and when scrolling down zoom into the letters) 


# Tech Stack: 

ThreeJs - Possibly
Svelte - Simplicity
Vercel - For web service



# Good Web designs

https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/Keita-Yamadas-designer-and-web-developer-portfolio.webp 
Comment : (minimal text navigation menu (Search this up for ideas the website above had good example))


# Color Theory:
https://elementor.com/blog/color-theory-web-design/

-Still want simplicity most likely using vibrant reds and simple whites could complement with Blacks

# Font/Psychology:
-Want something inviting yet also catching the eye of users
-Simplicity is key as I want users to easily navigate the page without any prior knowledge

https://x.com/socoloffalex/status/1806589283311980878(this twitter post similar to what i want/boycoy -> could switch up with vietnamese charcters and instead pf straight lines could improve by using different strucs)



# Currently Reading:
Better Web Typography for a Better Web by Matej Latin
Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger
Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton
https://blog.typekit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/combiningtypefaces.pdf (combining typeface -Tim)
Could add more book about ui search more





# Details:
- Bar showing how much percentage you have gone through the whole site (Githubs home page very good)
- Responsive buttons or animations
- Can change cursor(thinking of using a cursor)
-  Button animation(Signifier that button was pressed-page scrolls down or goes to next page-and color animation possibly)
- Also can add a page talking about books currently reading/interests(Can combine in about section)
- Take into account for mobile devices too!
- For the typfaces or fonts will probably have to find a typeface that feels heavy(uses height and contrast to seem bigger - More confidence when combining with a color like red which exudes confidence)
-Use websafe fonts possibly although we want good fonts or typefaces we dont just want to adjust for macbooks and apple devices but for devices that are older and take longer to load so even the smallest of changes of kb usage could be the difference between a usable one or a website that a user doesn't even want to use.(Even more specific since we are using english choose set of characters alone to save kb)
- use Fout (Have a two fonts one good one one bad -> Shift to good one when better connections) dont use foit since invis
- when using two different fonts remember to font smooth(What book used FF Meta(newer))
- The ideal width of a line of text is from 45 to 75 characters—including spaces
- ideal line height is usually between 1.3 and 1.6 times the size of the text (Darker text should have a larger line-height)
- The recommended line height for headings is usually 1 to 1.2 times
- Check page 60 of (better typography) for perfect typography example https://betterwebtype.com/triangle/ can practice this
- For like title of page can use typeface combinations (Example used in book was old one and new and modern one(create cosy environment) (Should be similar in xheight visualweight/vertical rhythm)
- https://codepen.io/matejlatin/pen/yoBdqK(example of combining with color + code is here)
- Horizontal rhythm mostly impacts the legibility, while vertical rhythm impacts the readability of the text and establishes a sense of visual hierarchy. (also show heirarchy of words ->  Main head -> Main Text -> Subtext
- Not using justified alignment at all
- Page 90 Better Web Typography for a Better Web (rhythm margins notes good to look at)
-  Can use drop for visual attention like Hi! 


# Things to consider for choosing typeface:
Goals:
The Text:
Typeface:Website about me
Body text or Heading:
Weights and styles
Font size in kb
Opentype - Bonus

What is OpenType?
OpenType is font format that was introduced by Adobe and Microsoft in
1997 as a successor to the PostScript and TrueType formats (now known
as “legacy” formats). The main benefits of this new format are:
100% cross-platform compatibility (it works on Mac OS, Windows,
Linux and is fully supported by the software industry)
all font styles are grouped in a single .otf file
larger character sets (65,536 characters per .otf instead of 210
characters per legacy font files)
larger character sets leads to extensive language support and
support for advanced typographic features.



#Info:
timewise app
data science(Tableu, Rstudio, Matlab)


Websites for fonts

Google
Fonts.com (More sophisticated)
Typekit (Most recommended)
